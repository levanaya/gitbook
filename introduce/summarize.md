# Hamster summarize

## What is Hamster?

Hamster is a decentralized computing network based on an underlying chain. It aims to provide users with cost-effective computing servers. It is a decentralized computing resource leasing platform that allows for leasing of idle computing resources. There are many cloud computing service vendors providing cloud computing services, but currently the prices of cloud computing services are gradually stabilized and high as the services expand. The goal of our product is to utilize the current idle computing resources in people's hands in a decentralized manner, so that users in need can use computing services in a low-cost manner. The project starts from providing full-stack hosting for blockchain application services as the usage scenario of shared computing services. Based on decentralized computing power sharing and automation technology, non-technical users can join the project with one click, which is safe, reliable, and free of operation and maintenance, greatly reducing the threshold to enter the blockchain world. As long as you have a computer, electricity and internet, you can provide computing power to many blockchain projects through Hamster and gain revenue; as long as you want to join web3, you can become a node of any popular blockchain project through Hamster and gain revenue with just one click.
